Hello World!

As you might already know, I'm Mark Muthii, and this is my personal blog site. By day, I am a student, and by night, I am a programming freak who spends his hours banging on the keyboard keys.

So, about this blog. In my daily escapades, I encounter and learn a lot of things, and it is these that I hope to share with the world. In a way, this will serve as my online journal/notebook/diary/all that good stuff.

Disclaimer: I am not a good writer (yet:)). That said, this will not be a perfect blog. I will make mistakes, no doubt. But those mistakes will not outway the informational stuff that I hope to share with you, so connect two and two where something little doesn't make sense, or where there's a typo, and read on.

Most of the posts I write will be on `programming`. But ocassionally, I will post non-programming articles (so don't leave just yet, non-techie).

One more thing is that, this is my personal project, using which I am learning `Jekyll`, and the templating language `liquid`. What that means is that, there's a high likelihood that one or more things will seem different (or completely broken) once in a while. Just ignore it for that time, and read what you can.

If you ever need to reach me, just hit that contact button up in the menu, fill the form, and I'll be in touch!

Happy reading! Looking forward to seeing where this leads...

But real quick before I go. Here are some interesting facts about this blog:

<ul>
  <li>It is built using <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">Github pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, the static site generator</li>
  <li>All the site files are hosted on <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a></li>
  <li>It is completely free (that's right. I didn't pay a dime. Not even for the domain)</li>
  <li>At the time of writing this, I am using the Clean Blog Jekyll theme created by <a href="http://davidmiller.io">David Miller</a>. (This will change in good time, as I plan to create my own theme)</li>
  <li>Setting it up was a pain in the butt (first time interacting with the Ruby development kit, Jekyll, liquid). I didn't know 80% of what I was doing. But I got it done</li>
</ul>
